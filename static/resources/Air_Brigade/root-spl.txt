You are a fighter pilot armed with a machine gun and missiles.  Your enemies are equipped with the latest technology!  They come at you in planes, helicopters, and super-sonic fighters!  You must destroy them all!  Each 5,000 points you rack up will give you an additional life.  There are also bonuses in the air: speed, rapid fire, extra life, health, and missiles.  Destroy as many of the enemy you can before your end closes in!  Good luck!
