Version 1.1.12
Rescue as many captured aliens as possible and transport them to their mother ship using your flying saucer in this single player game. Upon starting the game, you'll see an animation. As soon as your flying saucer gets to the alien planet and lands to the pad you may begin to control it. Direct your saucer to the prison where the aliens are being held hostage, and hit it by the rocket to free the aliens. After they leave the building, pick them up, and drop them off on the landing pad next to the mother ship. You can only carry 10 aliens on your board. Enemy tanks will try to destroy your flying saucer. Hit them and you'll receive the points! If you attempt to land your flying saucer while it is moving too fast or if it collides with a tower or a bullet from an enemy tank, it will explode, and one life will be taken. You also lose a life if you kill the alien or collide with enemy saucer. Hit it and you'll get the points. When you transport all the aliens of the prison, you have to land your flying saucer on the transforming station(pad) to go to the next level - another planet where your help is needed. The game ends when you lose all your lives. For full detailed rules see our site www.cybiko.com.
