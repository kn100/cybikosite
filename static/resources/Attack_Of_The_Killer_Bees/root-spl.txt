This is the single player game. The object of the game is to destroy as many as possible bees, and their hive, on each level, while trying to earn the maximum number of points. There are 9 levels in the game. If you collide with the soldier bees, you lose a lot of your health, and if you fail to kill it by shooting it with the sprayer you also lose some health. If you kill the Queen bee, the one that has more white coloring, you'll be invincible for a little while: you won't lose health when you touch the bees. If you kill the Drone (it looks like Queen bee, but has a more mixed design) the distance your sprayer will shoot will increase for a little while. Pick up sprayers to fill up your ammunition. Walk around the spilled honey, because if you step in it you'll get stuck for a bit. At the end of the level, you must destroy the hive to go to the next level.  If you fail, you'll have to pass the level again. You get points for each bee and nest destroyed. When you lose all your health, you lose a life. You have 3 lives in the game. You get one live for every 50 destroyed bees. The game ends and you are a winner if you successfully pass all nine levels. The game also ends if you lose all your lives.
