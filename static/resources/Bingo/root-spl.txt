Each player receives a card with numbers ranging from 1 to 75, and a set of counters. Each card has a different arrangement of numbers and contains a center square, usually marked "Free," on which a player may place a counter at any time.
In each turn the virtual banker draws a ball from the set of ball numbered from 1 to 75. Players with the corresponding number on their cards cover it with a counter. A player has a time limit to place the counters, after this time a player doesn't have an opportunity to cover the number.
As soon as any player covers a vertical or horizontal row of numbers, the player can yell, "Bingo!" If the player really won, the game is stopped. The player with BINGO is a winner.
If the player is wrong ("cries wolf") and he/she doesn't have BINGO the game continues. If the player "cries wolf" three times in the game he/she is kicked out. The game also ends when there are no more balls to draw. All players in this case are losers. In our variation of the game you can play with up to three opponents.
