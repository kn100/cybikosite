This is a single player game. The object of the game is to attain the highest score by performing the most successful tricks on the trampoline. At the start of the game, the player is centered on the screen, standing on the trampoline. The player is allotted 2 minutes to attain the highest score possible. First, the player has to jump. When he achieves the rebound effect from the trampoline, he has to perform tricks. The more difficult the trick, and the more individual moves that are in the trick, the more points are added. You get extra points for special combinations of tricks. The game ends when the 2 minutes are up.
