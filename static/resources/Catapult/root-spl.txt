This is a multi-player game. You can play with up to four opponents. You can also invite virtual opponents.
You have one catapult that can throw a ball. The object of the game is to be the last remaining player in the game. You can achieve this goal in two ways: hitting the opponents or dodging opponents' attacks. If a catapult loses all its hit-points it is considered killed and loses the game.
You can scroll the view of playing field and see your partners' location. When you point the crosshair on a catapult, its nickname and hit-points are shown.
The game round consists of command phases and execution phase. At command phase you select an action and set action parameters. When all the partners finish the command phase the execution phase begins.

Press <Enter> to enter the command phase.
