The object of the game is to move all of your pieces across the game field from one corner to the other before your opponent can move all his/her pieces to the opposite side. Players take turns making moves. Only one piece can be moved during a turn. Movements can be made vertically or horizontally, forwards or backwards to an unoccupied square. A piece can move only one square during a turn  (simple move), or it can jump over a single piece - either your own or your opponent's. You can make several jumps (multiple jumping) during a turn if it is possible. However, you can't combine simple moves with jumps.
The game is over when one of the players occupies the opposite city with their pieces.
The game can also be over if one of the players exceeds the game time, then the other player is a winner.
