Version 1.1.23
The goal of this single player game is to remember the number of figures on a picture that appears on the screen for a short time. Upon starting the game, you can choose the level of difficulty and set the options in the respective items of the main menu. The harder the level you choose, the shorter amount of time you will see the picture on the screen. The message 'GET READY!' will flash on the screen, and after this you have to be ready to view the picture with the figures. It flashes for a short time, followed by the question "How many figures?" You must try to answer this question.  If you are right, you'll get some points; otherwise, you'll just see the picture again to show you that you are wrong. Then a new picture will appear and everything repeats. If you answer correctly 25 times in a row you'll go to the next more puzzle level. The game lasts until you fail to answer correctly three times in a row. Try to be the best player in order to appear in the Top 10 list! For full detailed rules see our site www.cybiko.com.
View carefully the number of figures on the picture that flashes on the playing field, type this number in the screen when it appears and press <Enter>.
