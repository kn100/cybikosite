Version 1.1.8
What is CyBasicLite? It's a logic programming language; a pared-down version of CyBasic3. To enable you to easily create various programs without using a Memory Card, several functions and statements have been removed and the program interface has been slightly simplified (in comparison with CyBasic3). However, in comparison to the CyBasic language, CyBasicLite works faster while using less memory and several additional operators. If you've already learned how to program on CyBasic, CyBasic2 or CyBasic3, you'll be pleased with the new features that CyBasicLite has to offer. With CyBasicLite, you can create remarkable programs and teach your Cybiko computer to write and draw, perform complex calculus functions, play games, and compose music. What could be more captivating than this? Use the alphanumeric keys to enter the CyBasicLite operators in order to create a program. The detailed description of CyBasicLite and programming principles can be found at our site, www.cybiko.com.
