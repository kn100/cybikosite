Version 2.1.39
In this single player game, you are a racer and your goal is to achieve the fastest time while completing any races! There are 3 different races in the game that you may choose. In "Single Race", you choose the track and compete with 6 other racers. In "Time Attack", you have a limited time to complete the lap of the chosen track. If you do it, you go one more lap and the amount of time to complete the lap lessens and so on. The race continues until you fail to pass the lap in the amount of time allotted. Your record time in the "Time Attack" race will be the fastest lap time that you got. In Tournament mode, the races are organized by the exclusion method: at the end of the race on each track, the last place racer is eliminated from the race. So, at the end of the 5th race, 1 player will remain. This player is the winner. If you are the winner, you may take part in Tournament 2: the races on the other 5 tracks with the same conditions. If you win the Tournament 2, you'll get 2 prize tracks and may choose whether to race them in "Single Race" or "Time Attack" mode. Remember that as soon as you place last in the race in any Tournament, you will be eliminated. Upon starting each race, be ready when you see "Ready...". Following this, there will be a countdown from 3 to 1, and as "Go!" flashes on the screen, you begin controlling your car. At the end of each track you'll see 2 tabs with your results: one tab shows your time for each track you passed and the other tab shows each player's name and their best time on any track.
Press <Tab> to switch on/off the map.
Press <Esc> and choose the "Quit" button to quit the race.
Next you'll see the default settings for the actions, which you may change.
Use <Left/Right arrows> to move your car left or right.
Press  <Select> to accelerate.
Press <Enter> to decelerate.
