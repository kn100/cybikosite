Version 1.1.6
This is a single player game. The ultimate goal is to pass as many levels as you can. You control the spider that can move on the playing field in different directions. Your object on each level is to capture as much of playing field as possible by cutting off pieces of the screen and spinning a web in each part. The playing field has outlined borders, which are defined by your lines. You can move along these borders safely. There are enemy poisonous flies that can fly throughout the field. If you complete a closed shape on the playing field, the space inside that shape is trapped. This piece of playing field will be covered with a web. You pass to the next level if you capture more than the appointed percent of the screen area. Each second level the number of enemy flies increases by one. At the beginning of the game, your spider has 4 lives: one spider that you play and three spare spiders (your extra lives). You lose one life of your spider and any non-closed shape you were making is erased if: the enemy fly crosses your incomplete line, you cross your own incomplete line (for example, you can't move back over your own non-closed trajectory), or your time runs out. You are given a certain amount of time to cut off each piece of the playing field. If you don't finish cutting off a piece before your time is up, you lose one life. You get points for cutting off parts of screen. The more screen area you cut off, the higher your score will be. If you lose all your lives, the game ends.
