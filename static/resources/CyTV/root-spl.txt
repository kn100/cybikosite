Version 1.1.11
CyTV is a step-by-step business strategy game for four players. You control a TV Station. Your goal is to earn $50,000 as soon as possible, before your competitors beat you to it.  At the beginning of the game, you have three other opponents.  Since the game is turn-based, each turn is considered as complete only if all players have taken their turns. To take your turn, you have to first make a decision concerning the development of the strategy of your TV Station. The declaration of the next turn begins with a presentation of the ratings of all the players. Your rating determines the total amount of money your Station has at its command.
To develop your Station, and as a result increase profits, you can take charge of 4 different characteristics:
Price. This is the price that you set that the audience watching your TV programs must pay (one television viewer pays this price for one day). This characteristic can be changed from $1 to $20.
Quality. You can up-grade your TV programs in order to increase the audience watching them. This characteristic can be changed from 1 to 15. Each point of quality costs $250.
Broadcast time. You can increase the time during which your TV Station shows its TV programs. This characteristic can be changed from 1 hour to 24 hours. 1 hour costs $250.
Advertising. You can set the percentage of time spent on advertising in your programs. For advertising, you get a fixed payment from the advertisers. Watch out!  You can lose your audience. People don't like to watch advertisements! This characteristic can be changed from 0% to 100%.
After all players have taken their turns, the audience of each TV Station is counted. Your profit is determined by adding the money the viewers pay for watching your programs, and the revenue from advertising.
After one of players reaches the ultimate sum of $50,000, the game is finished.  All players earning greater than $50,000 will be considered winners.
