Version 1.1.19
Strain your brain and success may smile upon you, because your goal in this game for 2-4 partners is to be the first to obtain a score of 10,000 points or more! The players roll the dice in turn, following these rules: the player's whose turn it is rolls 5 dice. If he gets any points, he has 2 choices: "Roll" and "Stay", otherwise next player takes his turn. If the player chooses to "Stay", the points he rolled are added to his score and the next player takes his turn. If the player chooses to "Roll", he rolls again and may select the dice to roll. If he obtains a score that is higher than the one he got the previous time everything repeats: the player may choose to "Roll" or "Stay" etc. Otherwise, his turn is over and nothing is added to his score. The values that bring points: "1"-100, "5" - 50, 3 of the same values at the same time: "1" - 1000, "2" - 200, "3" -300, "4" - 400, "5" - 500, "6" - 600; the values in order "1" - "5" and "2" - "6" brings 300 points. If all 5 values score points, the player may choose to roll, and in this case he will roll all the dice again. The game ends at the end of the round when anybody obtains 10,000 points or more. The player whose score is highest wins!
