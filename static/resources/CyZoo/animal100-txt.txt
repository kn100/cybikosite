This animal lives in forests, mostly in California.

Biologists say that they seek sustenance from grasses, herbs and whatever carrion they can find. Of course, it is also a great lover of honey.

They spend the winter in dens, typically in the base of a rotted fir tree.

They are also fat and bumbling.
