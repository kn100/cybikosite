 It belongs to the species of great ape that inhabits the tropical rain forests and woodland savannas of equatorial Africa from the Gambia in the west to Lake Albert, Lake Victoria, and northwestern Tanzania in the east.

Its diet is primarily vegetarian and consists mostly of fruits, berries, leaves, and seeds. Termites and ants are eaten, and this animal occasionally stalks and kills young baboons and bush pigs. It has been observed poking twigs, grass, or other objects into ant and termite nests, withdrawing the tool, and eating the insects that cling to it.

It spends time both in the trees and on the ground. In the trees, where most of its eating takes place, it uses both hands and feet in moving about or swings by their arms from branch to branch. Movement over any significant distance usually takes place on the ground, where, though the ape may walk erect, it more often walks on all fours, leaning on the knuckles of its hands.

Genetic analysis indicates that it is the human's closest living relative.
