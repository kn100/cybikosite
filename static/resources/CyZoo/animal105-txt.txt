This animal lives in small family groups in habitats ranging from thick jungle to savanna.

It drinks by sucking water up into the trunk and then squirting it into the mouth. It eats by detaching grasses, leaves, and fruit with the tip of the trunk and using it to place this vegetation in the mouth.

Poachers hunt him because of his precious tusk.

It is characterized by its large size, long trunk (elongated nose), columnar legs, large ears and huge head.
