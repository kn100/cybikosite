It is found in the lowland tropical rainforests of the eastern Congo region and in the Lake Kivu region, including mountain rainforests and bamboo forests of the mountainous terrain to the north and east.

Its diet is vegetarian, and includes such foods as leaves, stalks, and shoots.

It has a lack of hair on its face, hands, and feet, and the chest of old males is bare. It's a stocky, powerful ape with black skin and hair, large nostrils, and prominent brow ridges. The adult animal has long, powerfully built arms and short, stocky legs. It has an extremely thick, strong chest and a protruding abdomen. It has a prominent crest on top of the skull and a "saddle" of gray or silver hairs on the lower part of the back.

It relegates itself primarily to travelling on the ground, usually walking about on all four limbs, with part of its weight supported on the knuckles of its hands. Very occasionally, it stands erect. This is an unaggressive, even shy, animal unless unduly disturbed.
