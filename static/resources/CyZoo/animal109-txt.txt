This is one of the largest mammals, and it lives in rivers, lakes, swamps, or other permanent bodies of water.  They live in groups typically numbering 7-15 animals in eastern and southeastern Africa.

During the day, it sleeps and rests in or near the water, and at night it emerges on to the land to feed on grasses that it cuts with its horny lips.

It has a barrel-shaped body, large mouth, short legs, and four toes on each foot. The skin is very thick, nearly hairless, and grayish brown on top, lighter and pinkish below. The ears and nostrils protrude so that they are above water when the animal is floating, with the rest of its body submerged. The mouth is enormous and can open extremely wide; the upper lip is thick and bulging; and the incisor and canine teeth are very large and grow continuously, as they are quickly worn away.

In water, it swims fast, can walk along the bottom, and can submerge. On land, it is a steady plodder, and can gallop for short distances, but it is never found very far from water. Its grazing range extends inland for only about 3 km (2 miles).
