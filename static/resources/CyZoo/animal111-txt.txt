This animal lives only in the coastal eastern Australia.

It feeds, very selectively, on eucalyptus leaves.

It is about 60 to 85 centimeters (21 to 33 inches) long and virtually tailless, with a stout, pale gray or yellowish body; broad face; big, round leathery nose; small, yellow eyes; and fluffy ears. Its feet are strong-clawed, and the two innermost digits of the front foot in addition to the innermost digit of the hind foot are opposable.

Unlike other tree-dwelling marsupials, it has a pouch opening rearward. It bears one offspring at a time; the youngster remains in the pouch for as long as seven months, clings to the mother's back until it is about a year old, and is weaned on the mother's excreta.
