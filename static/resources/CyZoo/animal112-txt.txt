The preferred habitats of this animal are grassy plains and open savanna.

It preys on a large number of animals ranging in size from gazelles and baboons upward to buffalo and hippopotamuses, but it prefers to hunt such medium- to large-sized hoofed animals as wildebeest, zebra, and impala and other antelopes.

The male's coat is short and varies in colour from buffed yellow to dark brown with a large mane on its head. The females are more consistently tawny or sandy in colour and don't have a mane.

This proud animal is called the king of beasts.
