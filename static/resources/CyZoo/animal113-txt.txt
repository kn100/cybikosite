It formerly lived in the jungles of mainland Southeast Asia.

It feeds mainly on wild figs and other fruits that it picks from trees, though it also eats smaller quantities of leaves, bark, and even insects.

It differs from the other apes in having a shaggy, reddish coat, an even greater disproportion between arm and leg lengths, and a differently shaped skull. The male is different from the female not only in being considerably larger but also in having cheek flaps of subcutaneous fatty tissue and an air sac that forms a baglike swelling hanging from the throat.

When walking, it places its clenched fists (rather than the knuckles) on the ground to aid locomotion. By nature, it is a placid, deliberate animal. It is highly intelligent, and in captivity it has shown considerable ingenuity and persistence, with a particular ability to manipulate mechanical objects.
