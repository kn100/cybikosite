It lives in dense thickets - a cautious lifestyle, since it is generally a prey animal.

It spends most of its time foraging and rooting for food: roots and acorns.

Its upper tusks, called honors, sharpen its bottom tusks, appropriately called rippers, in preparation for battle.

It is considered as the nearest relative of the pig, and, in layman's terms, it is called a wild pig.
