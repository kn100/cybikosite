It lives in Australia and in the area from Malaya to the Solomon Islands.

It has a massive, sword-like beak for cracking nuts, digging up roots, or prying grubs from wood; feeding is aided by a wormlike tongue.

It is a treetop, hole-nesting bird; at times, they form large, noisy flocks that damage crops.

It rarely becomes a good talker.
