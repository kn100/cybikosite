This bird subsists mainly on live, ground-dwelling prey.

It has a fully feathered (often crested) head and strong feet equipped with great curved talons.

It uses the same nest each year. It tends to nest in inaccessible places, incubating a small roost of eggs for six to eight weeks.

Because of its strength, it has been a symbol of war and imperial power since Babylonian times. Its picture is on many coins and crests.
