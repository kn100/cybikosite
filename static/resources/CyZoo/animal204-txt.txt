This bird wanders wildly over the oceans and seas in the Northern Hemisphere, which has about 30 species, ranging from temperate to arctic regions.

It scavenges for food, eating insects, mollusks, and crustaceans on beaches; worms and grubs in plowed fields; and fish and garbage from ships and along shores.

It is mainly gray or white, with variable head markings. In breeding season the head is either pure white or solidly black, gray, or brown; it becomes streaked or smudgy in winter.

It often gives vent to a strident, laughing call.
