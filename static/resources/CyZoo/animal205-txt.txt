It is usually found all around the world, but is most common in the tropics.

It usually feeds while wading quietly in the shallow waters of pools, marshes, and swamps, catching frogs, fishes, and other aquatic animals.

It has broad wings, long straight sharp-pointed bills, and powder downs; the latter are areas of feathers that continually disintegrate to a fine powder, which is used for grooming.

It commonly stands with its neck bent in an S shape. It flies with the legs trailing loosely and the head held back against the body, instead of stretching the neck out in front as most birds do. It nests in rough platforms of sticks constructed in bushes or trees near water.
