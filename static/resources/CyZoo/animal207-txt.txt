This bird dwells in the forests of New Zealand.

It sleeps by day in burrows and forages for food--worms, insects and their larvae, and berries--by night.

It's a grayish brown bird the size of a chicken. The eyes are small and inefficient in full daylight, the ear openings are large and well developed, and very long bristles (perhaps tactile) are found at the base of the bill.

It is a very unusual bird: the vestigial wings are hidden within the plumage, and the nostrils are at the tip (rather than the base) of the long, flexible bill.  The feathers are soft and hairlike; their legs are stout and muscular; and each of the four toes has a large claw.
