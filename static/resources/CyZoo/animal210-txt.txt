Two species of this bird originated in India, Sri Lanka and Burma, and now it's a staple resident of many of the world's zoos.

It prefers grains for food.

The male has a 90-130 centimeter (35-51 inch) body and a 150-centimetre (59 inch) train of tail feathers that are coloured a brilliant metallic green.

In courtship displays, the cock elevates his tail, which lies under the train, thus elevating the train and bringing it forward. At the climax of this display, the tail feathers are vibrated, giving the feathers of the train a shimmering appearance and making a rustling sound.
