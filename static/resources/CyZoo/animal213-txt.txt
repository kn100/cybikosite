This bird resides in Africa, southern Asia, Europe and North America. It is among the most durable of birds, inhabiting the northern tundra and coniferous forests, as well as barren mountains and deserts.

It's a noisy, aggressive omnivore whose diet includes rodents, insects, grain, and birds' eggs. In winter, especially, it is a scavenger and feeds on carrion, dead fish, and refuse.

It is a heavy-billed, dark bird. Usually, it is black in color but some species are white or brown.

It is a near-universal symbol of dark prophecy--of death, pestilence, and disease. Its cleverness and fearless habits have also won it a degree of admiration, as evidenced in its noble heraldic roles in the mythology of some peoples.
