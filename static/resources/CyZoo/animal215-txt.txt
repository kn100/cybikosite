It inhabits many parts of the world, including South and North America and Europe, in both dry land and watery areas.

It spends much of its time in the air, capturing insects; it is among the most agile of Passerine family of birds.

It is a small bird, with pointed narrow wings, short bills, and small weak feet; some species have forked tails. Plumage may be plain, or marked with metallic blue or green.

For nesting, it may use a hole or cranny in a tree, burrow into a sandbank, or plaster mud onto a wall or ledge, each of which will house three to seven white eggs. It has strong homing instincts.
