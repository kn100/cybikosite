It is one of the most beautiful birds and inhabits many areas of the world.

It eats seeds, grass and water-dwelling bugs.

It is a gracefully long-necked, heavy-bodied, big-footed bird that glides majestically when swimming, and flies with slow wingbeats and an outstretched neck.

It migrates in diagonal formation or V-formation at great heights: no other waterfowl moves as fast on the water or in the air.
