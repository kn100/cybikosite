It's a bird found in the tropics of the Americas.

It feeds on fruit, large insects, lizards, and nestling birds.

It has a thick bill that may be a third of the bird's length.  The bill is saw-edged and very light. The bird is brightly and distinctively colored, probably for species recognition--many birds have similar body patterns, mainly black with a bold breast color. The bill is believed to have a frightening effect on other birds, including hawks. When it eats, it must juggle pieces of fruit in its bill and then toss back its head before swallowing. Its wings are short and rounded, and the tail is usually long.

It is also among the noisiest of forest birds, with a wide repertoire of sounds. It is somewhat gregarious, tending to roost in treetop bands.
