It is widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions, but is absent from Australia and most oceanic islands.

Most of them have broad food habits, consuming carrion, garbage, and excrement, but rarely live animals. When one bird finds a dead or dying animal, others fly in from miles away. Feeding patterns maintain a strict social order, which is determined by species, based on body size and strength of beak. They all give way, however, to mammalian competitors (as jackals and hyenas).

It is a large, carrion-eating bird, with a bare head and large crops. Their feet are big but weak and flat, adapted to walking and to holding a carcass. In some, the beak is exceptionally strong and heavy because it is used for tearing hides and meat. Eyesight is well developed.

It may remain aloft for hours, soaring gracefully on long, broad wings.
