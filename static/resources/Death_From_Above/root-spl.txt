This is a single player game. Your object in this game is to attain the highest score by destroying all enemy targets on the ground and in the air. You control a powerful airplane that can fire shells and drop bombs. The jet can move in all directions. At the beginning of the game your jet has 3 "lives". To pass each level, you must score a certain number of points and destroy the enemy boss. The battle may occur over fields, desert or water, depending on level. There are two types of enemy in the game: Ground enemies (Tanks and Turrets on battleships) and Air enemies (Jets and Helicopters). Ground enemies can only be destroyed with bombs while air enemies can only be destroyed with shells. Any collision with enemy units or enemy bullets takes away jet health. At the end of each level, an enemy boss appears. The boss is a much larger enemy, and takes many hits to destroy. If you collide with the boss, you lose one life. There are 4 types of bosses: Large Tank, Large Fast Aircraft, Heavily Armed Helicopter and Speedboat with a mounted Gun. During the battle with the boss, other enemies will also attack you! When you get a certain number of points, a special prize will appear that you can pick up. There are 2 types of prizes: health pack (add a life to a health bar) and double-shot box (jet will fire 2 shells simultaneously). You score points for each destroyed enemy unit. If you pass the level without losing any jets, you will get 1000 additional points. The game will be over when you lose all lives.
