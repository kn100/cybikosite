Deer Season is a single player hunting game. The object of the game is to kill the correct deer in each of all 20 stages. Each stage has 1 buck and 1 doe. You control a crosshair used to aim at the deer. The crosshair can be moved on the screen in any direction. Stages increase in difficulty as the game progresses (the speed which the deer run increases, and there are an increasing number of obstacles in the foreground to obstruct the shots, etc.). At the beginning of each stage, a Buck (This is a male deer. Bucks are easily identified by the antlers on their head) or Doe (This is a female deer. Does are easily identified, because they have no antlers on their heads) Season is declared. You must kill the deer that is in season (either a buck, or a doe). You are allotted only 5 shots per stage to kill the deer in season. Watch out! Try not to spend any more shots than you have to. Depending where the deer is shot, it could take several shots to kill the deer. For each direct shot, you score a certain amount of points. If you kill the deer that is in season, you advance to the next stage. If you kill the deer that is out of season, or fail to kill the deer in season, the game is over.
