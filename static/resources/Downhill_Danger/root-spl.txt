This is the single player game. The object of the game is to guide a skier through a slalom course, avoiding trees and passing in between the flags that define the course, all in an attempt to attain the fastest run through the course.
While skiing down the course, try to pass through all the gates and avoid all trees along the way. Maintain a high speed in the run in order to show a better time, but remember that a high speed results in the loss in maneuverability. A 10-second penalty will be added to your time for each missed gate. If you collide with a tree, you significantly lose your speed, and a 20-second penalty is added to your time.
The game ends when you reach the finish line. Finish with a good time and you may be included in the Top Ten.
