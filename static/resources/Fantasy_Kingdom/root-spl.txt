In the book of magic, you can read the descriptions of what each sort of magic can do. There are 7 artifacts that can be found around the country and used to empower your hero. Your hero gains experience in battles, and also can find experience points around the country in chests. Your hero's level increases with the experience he earns and finds. Your castle yields 10 pieces of gold a day, and you can find gold treasures while wandering the land. A conquered mine will also provide you with gold. In the beginning of the game, you get an army, some gold, and some incantations.  You can obtain more of each as you proceed through the game.
