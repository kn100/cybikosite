Version 1.1.20
Win the title of Champion in Froggie's Race, in which you compete with your fellow frogs in your native river! You are a small frog that participates in the races on a river full of danger and obstacles. Nine other frogs will compete with you. There are five heats in the Race. To go to the next heat, you have to be in the Top 3 of the race before. While running on the river, avoid the water lilies and other snags, because, upon collision with them, you'll lose your speed. Beware of the hungry herons standing in the water and snakes that will unexpectedly appear from the reeds: they certainly wouldn't mind eating you. A sudden sound will inform you about the arrival of your enemies. The game ends if a heron or snake eats you or if you fail to get into the Top 3 at the end of any heat. The game also ends if you complete the race, and you are the champion if you are take first in the fifth and final heat!
