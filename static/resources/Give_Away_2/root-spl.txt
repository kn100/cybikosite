The rules are identical to Wireless Checkers, but the object of the game is completely different: to give away all your checkers, or to block remaining ones so that none of them can be moved.
The game is played using 64-square board and two players. White moves first. A move is made forward to an adjacent open square; a capture is made by jumping forward over an adjacent opponent's piece into a vacant square. You must jump and capture an opponent's piece whenever possible (or when the opportunity arises). You will not be allowed to make another move until you make a capture when it is available to you. If you can continue to jump and make multiple captures, you must do so and take all the pieces. A single checker piece is made a "king" when it has successfully reached the opponent's back or "starting" row. A king is denoted by crown image. Kings may move and capture diagonally forward and backward. Single pieces may capture kings. In the game on two Cybikos each player has the game time - the time for a player's own moves. If you exceed this time you lose. The game can end in draw.
