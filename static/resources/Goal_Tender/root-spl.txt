Version 1.1.3
This is a two-player strategy game. You have a character that you can control on the grid playfield. The object of the game is to push the balls around on the playfield in an attempt to out-score your opponent. Both players have their own balls - light or dark, and the goal areas. Your goal area is always at the top of the screen, and your balls are placed in the lower part of the screen at the beginning. Each player is allowed to push only one ball of their color per turn. The balls can be pushed in the direction that the character is moving except for pushing down. Once the ball is pushed, it will keep going until it hits another ball, enters the goal area, or falls off the screen. The character cannot push a ball if there is another ball on the opposite side, which would stop it. The lines of the grid are marked with numbers from 0 to 35. You earn 50 points for each goal you score, and the difference between the numbers of the line where the ball stopped and the line where the ball started moving (if you didn't make a goal). The game play continues until it is determined that neither player can make a move, or until the game time runs out. The winner is the one that scores the most points.
