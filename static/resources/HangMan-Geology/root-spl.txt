This is a single-player word game. The object of the game is to guess a word, letter by letter, while making the fewest wrong guesses as possible. This Hang Man game has the theme of "geology."
You may define the difficulty level so the game generates longer or shorter words depending on how hard you want it to be. 
Each word is presented as a series of blank lines. Each line is a non-guessed letter in the word. You suggest a letter from the alphabet. If that letter is one of the characters in the word, then it is placed into the word. Otherwise the picture of a hung man is begun or continued! One man is hung if you guess incorrectly six times. When you guess one word, the next word will be presented to you. 
The game ends when you guess all the words in the session. Then the number of hung men is counted and you will see your result.
The "Settings" screen allows you to adjust the game options.
