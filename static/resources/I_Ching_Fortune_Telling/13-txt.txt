       Tung Jen.               Fellowship         Like-minded people are   simply necessary to you  - without them you'll    fail. If you fight for   lofty aims, you may      bravely go into action:  the person least likely  to be an ally will       support you. Things will soon take a turn for the better. Although you are slightly diffident, your wish will most likely be fulfilled.
