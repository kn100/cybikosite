         Da Xu.           Great Accumulation      There is a lull in your  life, but good times are just around the corner.  Make sure you have       enough power to overcome this lull before startingon a journey. Don't      withdraw into yourself - you are in need of       interaction with others  as never before. Don't   try to rush into things- the result  can turn out the opposite of what you wish. Your wish          fulfillment depends on   how you can adapt to new circumstances.
