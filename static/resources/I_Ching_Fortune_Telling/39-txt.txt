         Jian.                  Trouble           This is one of the worst hexagrams. You can't makea reality of your plans, and your desires don't   match up with your       opportunities. Abandon   any activities - all     attempts to proceed are  doomed to fail. Try to   find out the reasons thathave led to such a       situation. Refrain from  taking a part in crowded actions. As for your wish- you don't have to worrytoo much. If the wish is to be fulfilled earlier  than is needed, this willbring only harm.
