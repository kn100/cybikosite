          Kun.                 Adversity          This is one of the worst hexagrams. A recession ofsorts has happened in    your life. Everything youdo is doomed to fail.    Don't perceive this as a tragedy; wait it out, andeventually this bad luck streak will end. For the time being, you have to  think thoroughly on your plans for the future - atthe present, they are    neither clear nor        organized. Pay less      attention to the gossip  behind your back. Your   wish will come true, and the result will exceed   all expectations.
