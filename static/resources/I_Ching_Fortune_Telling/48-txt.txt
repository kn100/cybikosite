         Jing.                 The Well           The greatest part of yourhardships is behind you, but quite a few of them  are yet to come. Act     leisurely, thinking      thoroughly about every   action you make. Those   around you will be of    little help. Seek        strength in yourself. Tryto occupy yourself with  the tasks at hand for    long periods of time...  even if you would rather do something different.  The fulfillment of your  wish depends mainly on   other people. Don't      attempt to weigh upon    them; rather, wait for   the appropriate moment   patiently. Haste in this case can spoil everything.
