-This is the %d%s time    you have asked the I     Ching today. It is not   recommended to tell      fortunes more than       three times a day, since frequent divination      lowers the precision of  oracles.                -Don't ask the same       question twice, even if  you are not satisfied    with the oracle or it    seems to you too gloomy.-In a seance, try to ask  only one question.      -Don't feel upset if an   answer doesn't satisfy   you. Follow the oracle's advice and things will   turn for the better.    -Don't ask the I Ching    if your intentions may   do harm to other people, or if the fulfillment of your wish will require   unworthy means. Approach it with an open heart    and mind.
