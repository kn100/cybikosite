This is a two-player game. The path (it may be a maze) has two gates on opposite ends. You start off on one gate while your opponent starts off on the other gate. Your goal is to get to the other end of the maze while driving your locomotive on the track before your opponent makes it to the opposite end. Upon starting the game, you choose the level of difficulty (agree with your opponent to play with chosen game).
