Version 1.3.13
The MP3 lets you listen to MP3 files, record your voice, via a little built-in-microphone, and listen to FM radio! And you can do all this at the same you're your playing your favorite games! All you need is to slap the Cybiko MP3 Multimedia System into the expansion slot on your Cybiko computer, and the music is yours!  All MP3s and voice recordings are stored on the removable Smart Media Card, that is, in turn, stuck into the MP3 cartridge. For full detailed rules/descriptions see our site www.cybiko.com
