Version 1.1.8
Pass all five levels of the ominous cave with your hero and grab a pile of points for destroying the evil spirits as you search for the entrance to the cave!
You move around in the underground maze by overcoming the obstacles and shooting the monsters along your way. Your goal is to get to the stairs - the passageway to the next level. Pick up these bonuses: "bullet" - to get a bullet and some points, "boots" - to pass through the fire, "key" - to open the doors (which will lead you toward the entrance to the cave), and "flower"  - a bonus that makes you invincible for a short time (it also lets you destroy enemies upon touching them). Press fairy button at any end of the maze to raise the bar that blocks your way. When you reach a revolving door, think about which side you have come to the door from. Don't fall down on the banana peel. As you go upstairs, you'll go to the next level and get a large amount of points. Upon starting the game, you have 3 lives. Each time you run into a monster, you lose a life. If your hero loses all his lives, the game ends. If you pass all the levels, the game has a happy end. Try to get the maximum number of points to get into the Top 10!
