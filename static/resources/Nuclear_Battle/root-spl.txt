Version 1.1.25
This is strategy game for 2 to 4 players. The goal of the game is to survive a nuclear attack and to destroy your opponents' civilizations. Upon starting the game, you have 5 cities and 100,000 habitants. You also have sizable armed forces, including nuclear and chemical weapons, highly developed military technology, anti-aircraft defense stations, and communication facilities. At the left and right edges of the screen, there are buttons that represent the game actions. While moving through the buttons, you'll see a description in a scrolling line across the bottom of the playing field and information about the current state of any object in the info screen at the upper part of the playing field. The image of your last action is in the left central screen. The current information is in the right central screen: by default, the number of citizens in all of your cities is displayed here.
Use <Arrows> to choose the button while reading the description of the button at the bottom of the screen and press <Enter>. The buttons are numbered from top to bottom and left to right. For the 3rd, 5th and 8th buttons, choose the <Cyname> to which you want to apply the action. For all other buttons, choose the concrete object or type of defense (if it's required). Press <Enter> to perform the action; otherwise press <Esc>. Press <Ok> to confirm the chosen action or press <Cancel> to cancel it.
All players move at once. After everyone has taken their turn, you'll see an animation showing what each player has done, along with the results.
