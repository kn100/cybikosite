You can invite up to four friends to join you in this game. The object of the game is to be the last remaining player. In the game cycle one player is a challenger and the others are followers. If player-challenger hits the rim, then all other players get one chance at making a counter shot - a shot from the place where player-challenger scored, correctly guessing the shot power needed to score a hit from the selected location.
If any player-follower misses the counter shot, that player will get the next sequential letter from the word "PIG" held against him/her.  Each player who scores the word "PIG" leaves the game - he/she is a game loser.
If player-challenger misses, the next player becomes a challenger.
