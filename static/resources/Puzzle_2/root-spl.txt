Your goal is to compose pictures from the Gallery. Each picture is divided into 16 fragments. You have the Fragments List - the collection of fragments that you use composing your picture. However, you won't have all fragments for the pictures in the Fragments List. You will receive virtual Presents with the fragments from your Cybiko. You can receive some fragments from your friends that have the Puzzle game on their Cybikos. If you want to present a fragment to your friend's Puzzle game, you can also do this.
Enjoy a fine animation after you've completed the puzzle and composed a picture!
