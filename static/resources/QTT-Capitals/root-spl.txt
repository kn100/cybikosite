Version 1.1.2
  This two-player strategy game played on the 3X3 grid of 9 squares is an educational variant of Tic-Tac-Toe. The goal of the game is to be the first player to claim 3 squares, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game only lasts a limited time. Each player gets his/her own game piece, either an "X" or a "0". The game starts out with the player using "X"'s taking the first turn. During a turn, when a player selects a square a question will appear. The question will be multiple choice, and the player will be able to select choice 1, 2, 3 or 4. When the player chooses correctly, his/her game piece will be placed in that square.  Otherwise, the opponent's game piece will be placed there. If any player has two pieces placed in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line and the other player incorrectly guesses for the remaining square, that square will not fill in with the opponent's game piece. The game ends when either all the squares are taken up, if a player gets 3 of his/her pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, or the game time runs out.
