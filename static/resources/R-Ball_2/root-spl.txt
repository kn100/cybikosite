This is a single player game. The goal of the game is to score the most points.
The game has three levels of difficulty.
You have two paddles that are attached to a circle. You can rotate the paddles together around the center of the circle. A ball is fired from the center. You have to rotate your paddles so that you keep the ball inside the circle. You score points for keeping the ball in the circle. Depending on the level, you get 10, 15 or 25 points for every time you knock the ball back inside the circle. You'll meet different obstacles in the game: your paddles may shrink or close in together for some time, the Blocker (a large paddle in the center of the circle) may appear, and lizards running around inside the circle may appear to change the direction of the ball, and two false paddles may pop up to confuse you. When you successfully pass an obstacle, you get 300 points for it. There are three balls at the beginning.
You get one ball for every 1,000 points. If you can't return a ball and it goes outside the circle, you lose a ball. If you lose all the balls, the game ends.
