Version 1.1.5
This is a one-player game in which you maneuver a helicopter carrying the hero, Angel, through the game stages: underground caves, sewer net and the plant corridors. Each of the stages has two levels. Your goal is to pass them all in order to find the nuclear reactor and destroy it. On your way, you may cross paths with rats, bats, and war dogs. Fight them or escape them; otherwise they will hurt you. Avoid or destroy fireballs - they will hit you when you touch them. Ventilator airwaves and geyser steam will lift your light helicopter up. Volcanoes may erupt suddenly and hit you. You'll lose a life if you get caught in the blades, in the high voltage, and also if you are hit by a laser gun. Press a special button to turn off the laser barrage and to open the bars. Angel is armed only with stones. Stone boxes and medicine chests found around the passages will help him. To reach the next level or stage, Angel has to find a passage. You earn points for each destroyed fireball and killed enemy. At the beginning of the game, Angel is given 6 lives. Once his health runs out, he loses a life. The game ends when you lose all your lives. There can be situations in which you haven't yet lost all your lives, but can't go anywhere. In this case you may restart the game. You win the game after you destroy the nuclear reactor on the 3rd level.
