Place your bet on the roach you think will finish the race first.
The game can be played in two modes: vs. Cybiko and vs. your friends (up to 5 people can participate in the game).
In the game vs. Cybiko if the roach you bet on finishes first, your bet is paid back 5 to 1. Otherwise, your money is lost. Your goal is to get rich as fast as possible!
In the game vs. your friends, your prize depends on how much the other players have bet on which roaches. All bets are added and divided between the winners. If a bunch of people all bet on the winning roach, you have to split the pot.
Roach races start automatically every 2.5 minutes in multi-player mode, and every 2 minutes in a game against your Cybiko, or after all bets have been placed. If you make no bets in a race, you'll pay 10 Cy$ for watching the race.
You win when your opponents are out of cash. In a game against your Cybiko, you win if you get 20,000 Cy$.
You lose when you have no money left.
Use <Up/Down arrows> and press <Enter> to choose a roach from the list.
Use numeric keys to enter your bet and press <Enter> to accept your bet. Press <Esc> to reject your bet.
Press <Tab> to check results during 30 seconds after a multi-player race is over.
