You are a security guard in a big hotel. You have to protect the hotel from the different bandits which seek to rob the joint. Shoot the armed bandits or use the explosives to destroy them, but try not to kill the innocent bystanders. Some of the robbers are extremely smart and look like regular people. You must only shoot at them if you see a gun at their hands. Watch out! The robbers will fire at you, and you must do all you can to stay alive!
