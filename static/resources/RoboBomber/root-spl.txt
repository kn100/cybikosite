Version 1.1.10
RoboBomber is a two-player game, in which the goal is to kill your opponent 10 times. You start the game armed only with a dagger. More weapons (bombs, grenades, Tommy gun and bullets and missiles for it) can be found around the vault. Bullets and missiles can go through the walls; missiles can be blown up when you want. Other bonuses are a first-aid kit and invulnerability for 30 seconds. The bonuses are restored after a minute. Your health will decrease as you are hurt by fire, explosions and enemy hits. Once you are killed, you'll return to where you started and have only a dagger and invulnerability for a few seconds, whereas your opponent saves everything they have.
