Version 1.1.16
This is a two-player logical game on a 3x10 playfield. The object of the game is to travel around the board and remove all your pieces before your opponent. Both of the players have 5 chips that are on the board at the beginning of the game. The number of sticks (1 - 4) turned with the white side out is the number of the squares you can move during your turn. If there are all black sides, you have 6 squares to move. If you get 1, 4 or 6 squares to move you have the next turn, if you get 2 or 3 of them the turn passes to your opponent after you move your piece. Your chip may land on an unoccupied square or on the square with one of your opponent's pieces. If the chip lands in the square with an opponent's piece, the chips switch places. Two pieces in a row cannot be eaten. Three pieces in a row cannot be jumped over. If the piece can't move forward, it can move backward. If no piece can be moved, the player passes his turn. The players' pieces cannot be removed from the board if any are in the top row.  If a piece lands on the magic cell, it may be safe from having to change places with an opponent's piece or it may move to another magic cell. If that another magic cell is occupied than the piece lands on the nearest to the path start unoccupied cell. The game ends when any player removes their chips from the playing board. This player is the winner.
