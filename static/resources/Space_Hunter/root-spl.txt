Your ship is equipped with a laser that is able to destroy the enemy space ships that will try to attack you. Your spaceship has a limited shield that suffers damage when any encounter with an object or a spaceship occurs. You can pick up some power-ups, which can increase the level of protection and ammo. The game has four stages. Each next stage demands more bravery and accuracy. Your goal is to complete the breakthrough!
