The game has 11 levels, and each has it's own do or die mission!  It is your blood debt to your race to complete each!  Smoke all ships, meteors and other unfriendliness!  You score points for shaking down each object. Every 4,000 points gives you an extra life. And some kills will give you bonuses: advanced weapons, armor or "life".
