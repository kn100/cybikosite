The game is played on a 3x3 grid of 9 squares. The game is broken down into turns. Each player gets his/her own game piece, either an X or an O. The player with X has the first turn. During a turn, a player places his/her sing in the empty square. The game ends when either all the squares are taken up (draw), or if a player gets 3 of his/her pieces in a line, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The player that gets a line of three X's or O's first wins the game.
