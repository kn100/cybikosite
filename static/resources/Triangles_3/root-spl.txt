Move all your disks across the game field, from one corner to another, faster than your opponent.
Disk can move in all (horizontal, vertical and diagonal) directions, only one square at a time to an unoccupied square. Disk can also jump over a single disk, either yours or your opponent's. You can make several jumps (multiple jumping) during one turn if possible. However, you can't combine both jumps and simple moves at the same time.
In the game on two Cybikos each player has the game time - the time for the own moves. If you exceed this time you lose.
