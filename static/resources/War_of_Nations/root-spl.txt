Version 1.1.13
In this two-player game, your goal is to be the first player who scores 20 points by destroying his opponent's heroes. Upon starting the game, you choose your hero: a human that can walk and fly; a spider that can walk and jump; and a beholder that flies. You are traveling across the planet with your hero and you must kill your opponent's hero by shooting at him. Each hit takes some health from the recipient. When the hero's health expires, he dies; the player that destroys his/her opponent gets a point and the game continues with the next round and the revived hero. Use the transforming station for quick transportation from one place to another. The game ends when any player scores 20 points.

Press <Up arrow> or <Select> to jump with the spider.
Hold <Up arrow> or <Select> to fly up with the human. The longer you hold the button, the higher up you fly.
Press <Up/Down arrows> to fly up or go down with the beholder.
While holding <Up> or <Select>, press <Left/Right arrows> to fly with the human (or jump with the spider) left or right.
Go to the transforming station and press <Down arrow><Tab> to transport the beholder; press <Tab> to transport the human or the spider.
Press <Esc> and choose the "Quit" button to exit the game.
