Your goal is to pass all levels of the game. You pass a level by destroying the most blocks, hitting each of them with your ball, before the well fills in. You have a circle shaped paddle, a ball, and a well where the blocks appear. The height of the well is the same as the height of six blocks.  Each level starts with only a couple of layers of blocks filled in. A block is destroyed when the ball hits it. The paddle can be moved in any direction: right, left, up, down or diagonally over the well. You need to move the paddle so that it hits the ball when the ball flies closer to you. At the beginning of the game you have one playing ball and two spare balls (your extra lives). If you don't hit the ball with the paddle, it will disappear and you will lose one ball. But keep in mind that you can get additional balls (maximum of six at one time) by destroying a certain kind of block. From time to time, blocks will appear in the well. If the blocks fills at least one column (one column can contain six blocks) then you will lose one ball and you will start over. The game has 8 levels and the speed of your ball increases with each new level. The game will end when you lose all your balls.
