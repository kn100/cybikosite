You goal is to destroy all islanders. Your army consists of the General, the infantry, the light horse, the elite horse, and two modern cannons. If the General is destroyed in the battle the army loses the fight. 
A unit is a square with one-type of soldiers. When the larger unit is destroyed it changes into a smaller unit, if the smallest unit is destroyed it irretrievably disappears from battlefield. Each unit has its fire and movement range. A unit, except a cannon, can't fire through a palm.  Also, a cannon is unable to rotate and can only shoot straight, but it can shoot through the palms.
In one move you can use all your units. The unit can't move if it already fired or made all go-steps. After you make all your movements and take all your shots, you have to pass your move to the islanders. When it's your turn to move your General is shown, and has an active pointer.

To fire use <Select> or <Tab> to prepare to fire: note the direction and range of the shot, and then press <Enter>. Press <Ins> while preparing to fire or to return fire.
